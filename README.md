# Cuesoft Backend Engineer Coding Interview

Welcome to the Cuesoft Backend Engineer Coding Interview repository! This README will guide you through the steps required to participate in the interview process. The interview consists of two parts - an assignment to be completed prior to the live interview, and a live coding exercise.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Pre-interview Assignment

Please complete the following steps:

#### Step 1: Fork This Repository

Begin by forking this repository to your own GitHub account.

#### Step 2: Create a Serverless Application

Create a serverless application using the TypeScript template.

#### Step 3: Configure ESLint and Prettier

Set up ESLint and Prettier in your project for code linting and formatting.

#### Step 4: Set Up LocalStack and DynamoDB

Set up LocalStack and a DynamoDB instance on your local machine. The DynamoDB instance will be used for user creation.

#### Step 5: Set Up a Test Suite

Create a test suite for your application. Write test cases for user sign-in and sign-up functionalities.

### Part 2: Live Coding Exercise

During the live coding session, you will be asked to perform the following:

#### Step 1: Create a Signup Function Endpoint

Create an endpoint for user sign-up. The function should accept the following user details:

- Name
- Email
- Phone
- Address

#### Step 2: Create a Sign-in Function Endpoint

Create an endpoint for user sign-in. The function should accept user email and password for authentication.

#### Step 3: Create a Random Function Endpoint

You will be instructed to create a random function endpoint during the live coding session. This endpoint must have authentication and authorization enabled.

#### Step 4: Add Test Cases

Write test cases for the newly created endpoint in step 3.

### Additional Notes

During the live coding session, the examiner may ask you random questions regarding system design patterns, Node.js, JavaScript, and TypeScript as you code. This is designed to assess how well you work under pressure and supervision.

## Evaluation

Your assignment and live coding exercise will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Code quality and clarity
- Adherence to best practices
- Problem-solving skills
- Knowledge of the relevant technologies and patterns

## Tips

- Make sure your code is well-commented and organized.
- Focus on delivering solutions that not only work but are also scalable and maintainable.
- Be prepared to explain your thought process and the choices you make.

Thank you for participating in the Cuesoft Backend Engineer Coding Interview. We are excited to see your skills in action!

Best of luck!
